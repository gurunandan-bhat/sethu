{{< fellowship src="Image62.jpg" text="I’m grateful to have worked with such a talented and dedicated team. It’s been nothing short of a miraculous experience for me in the last year. Sethu as workplace has set high standards for me which will be difficult to get anywhere. I felt like coming to Sethu even when I was not feeling well just because of the wonderful people out there. I have no doubt that this team will reach new heights. I’m looking forward to listening to more and more success stories of Sethu and its members." author="Dr Nilanjan Majumder, IAP Fellow, 2023–2024" >}}
