A healthy corpus enables us to concentrate on doing what we do best rather than struggle to fundraise just to keep the lights on month on month. Contributions to our corpus help us focus on our mission – to be a centre of excellence in child development, family-centred care and inclusion through interdisciplinary services, training, advocacy and research,– and maintain service quality and continuity no matter what eventuality strikes.
