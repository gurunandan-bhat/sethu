Twenty years since we started, we can no longer overlook our need for a space that lends itself to giving and getting the best of our professionals and those we serve (10,000 registrations and counting!). So we embarked on our most audacious project.

Our new, inclusive building, the first of its kind in Goa, will provide:

- Custom-equipped rooms for therapy, counselling, and testing to provide comprehensive, individualised assessments and therapies, and reduce waiting time.
- Family-centred care in welcoming, comfortable spaces where families can access resources and connect supportively with our professionals and other families.
- Space for workshops, support groups and programmes vital to our mission of building an inclusive, neurodiversity-affirming community.

Because Every Child Deserves to be Nurtured and Celebrated

The post-pandemic price rise has increased the cost of building our new centre, raising our initial estimate to Rs 10 crore, of which we've already raised Rs 6 crore. We’re halfway there already but need your help for the rest of our journey. Join us! Together, let’s build a place where neurodiversity is celebrated, and inclusion thrives!
