**Shivam 15**, first came to Sethu when he was just 1 year old. Initially non-speaking, he gradually developed functional communication with his parents. Thanks to his sponsored Speech and Language Therapy sessions, Shivam now uses Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) to express himself more effectively. His progress has been transformative, and communicates in ways that were once unimaginable.
