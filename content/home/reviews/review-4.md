“Aditya was 11 when we met Dr Nandita by chance and explained why he had the habit of holding his breath underwater for extended periods. Not one doctor since he was five had been able to explain it. We went home and tried what she suggested and he was such a happy cookie. Next day we were at Sethu and have been like _betaal_ behind Vikram ever since”

--- Seema Sundaram, mother of Aditya, 23, who went on to acquire degrees from Linnaeus University, Sweden, and Brunel University, London, and become an internationally certified game ranger, open water diver and author in the making.
