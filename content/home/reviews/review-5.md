“(Sethu works in a) systematic way with children, their parents, families, schools and teachers so that children grow up in an environment where they’re accepted and loved for who they are and what they have to offer the world. We’ve been touched by the passion and commitment of the Sethu team. We know many people who have been very happy to have volunteered at Sethu.”

--- Ligia and Jaime da Fonseca, Sethu donors
