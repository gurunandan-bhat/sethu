“Ojas was diagnosed with autism as an infant but we didn’t want to accept the diagnosis at the time. Many doctors and elders told us he’d start speaking any day. But eventually we realised it wasn’t going to happen. He used to be very hyper. He’s calmed down a lot because of the therapy. He’s very excited about coming here.”

--- Prashant Rajput, uncle of Ojas, 12
