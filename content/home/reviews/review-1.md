“I’d forgotten myself so completely that I didn’t realise that if I don’t have peace of mind, I can’t help my child. That’s when I started sessions for myself as a mother. I came back to Sethu and booked a session with the therapist for myself. After some sessions I realised that to be there for my son 100%, I need to have my 100% first. I still sometimes struggle with this but with time I’m improving.”

&mdash; Deepa Oli, Sethu Mum
