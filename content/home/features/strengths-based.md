We focus on identifying, building upon, and leveraging the existing skills, abilities, and resources of each child and their family to promote positive outcomes and growth.

Shanaya (name changed), an energetic and expressive 10-year-old, has a deep love for music, especially the piano and guitar. Her mother reached out to Sethu with concerns about Shanaya’s need for frequent reminders, emotional intensity, and challenges with everyday routines.

Detailed input from both her parents and teachers was gathered, leading to a diagnosis of ADHD. Her mother received information on neurodiversity, executive functioning, and Shanaya’s unique strengths. She also joined Sethu’s ADHD Parent Support group on Signal to connect with other caregivers.

Through behaviour support sessions, Shanaya’s mother explored ways to reduce stress, use visual cues and timers, and weave Shanaya’s love for music into daily tasks. Shanaya, working with a counsellor, reflected on her strengths and identified areas where support helped her do her best.

Reflecting on the journey, her mother shared, “These tools have helped me better understand and support my child. I’m learning to celebrate who she is, while creating a space where she feels safe, seen, and able to shine.”
