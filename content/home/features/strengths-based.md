We focus on identifying, building upon, and leveraging the existing skills, abilities, and resources of each child and their family to promote positive outcomes and growth.

At Sethu, we’re all about listening to those we serve. Once, in conversation with RR, whose son was diagnosed with autism in 2022, we understood that she’d attended our Agle Kadam sessions upon the recommendation of one of our clinical staff, so that she could get clarity about her next steps.

Learning that your child has a developmental disability is a big deal for a parent, and reactions can range from disbelief to grief, rage or relief about finally having some direction. What she found most useful, RR said, was the emphasis we place on parental self-care. It was a difficult time for her, compounded by the recent loss of a family member. Our facilitator’s discussion on the importance of self-care really hit the spot, prompting her to become more conscious of her own needs and health. RR has since begun making time for herself and her spiritual growth through activities like walking and attending church. Where she’d found her child’s crying over being separated from her very overwhelming before, she learnt she could transform it into a game of hide and seek – a dash of fun for everyone. She attributes the Agle Kadam session with being eye-opening in many ways
