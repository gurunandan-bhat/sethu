We focus on identifying, building upon, and leveraging the existing skills, abilities, and resources of each child and their family to promote positive outcomes and growth.

Shanaya (name changed) an energetic and expressive 10-year-old, has a passion for music, enjoying both piano and guitar. Her mother sought an assessment at Sethu, suspecting Shanaya might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) due to her need for frequent reminders for daily tasks like brushing her teeth and packing her school bag. Shanaya often misplaced her belongings and had trouble starting school assignments. She also experienced intense emotions when disappointed, which her mother found challenging to manage.

Detailed input from both her parents and teachers was gathered, leading to a diagnosis of ADHD. The diagnosis was shared with Shanaya’s mother, along with resources on neurodiversity, executive functioning, and Shanaya’s strengths. She also joined Sethu's ADHD Parent Support group on Signal. Through individual behaviour management sessions with our psychologist, Shanaya’s mother received support in setting up visual reminders for morning tasks, using timers, and incorporating music to make routine activities more enjoyable. Shanaya, working with a counsellor, explored her strengths and identified “forgetfulness” as an area where she needed assistance.

As the sessions concluded, her mother expressed gratitude, saying, “I am incredibly grateful for all the strategies I have been taught and continue to learn in my journey of better understanding my child with ADHD. These tools and insights have empowered me to support my child in more meaningful and effective ways, allowing me to embrace her uniqueness while navigating the challenges with patience and compassion. Each new lesson helps me grow as a parent, giving me the confidence and knowledge to create an environment where my child can thrive.”
