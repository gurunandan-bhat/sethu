We prioritise the needs, values, and involvement of the entire family in decision-making and care, ensuring that interventions support not just the child but also their family systems.

Mahesh, 6, adores dinosaurs. While working on his ‘This is Me’ document recently, his candid response in the ‘Family’ section was his dislike of his mother’s shouting. At first this caused some embarrassment to his parents but we assured them that Mahesh’s honesty was a sign that they’d created a psychologically safe environment in which their child felt confident about expressing his true feelings. Since then, his mother has actively worked on stress management, and finding balance through Zumba sessions that help her stay energised, calm, and more patient with Mahesh. This goes to show how tools like This is Me amplify children's authentic voices and encourage families to find strategies that support their child and enhance family functioning. By fostering open communication in a structured manner, together with professional support, the This is Me framework empowers families to create nurturing and responsive environments for their children’s growth.
