Sethuâ€™s greatest asset is our highly qualified, committed, multi-disciplinary team that provides award-winning services to neurodevelopmentally disabled children and their families, offers training programs to educational institutions, partners with Government and Social purpose organizations in the disability space to build advocacy and works with the community to change the doom and gloom narrative of disabilities to one of strengths and hope.
