Our training for families, teachers, students and other professionals is delivered through webinars and in-person collaborative workshops on a range of subjects, such as sexuality education, ADHD, behaviour and inclusion in school. They’re particularly powerful in that they share the lived experiences of parents who’ve experienced success in these areas.

Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay notified about upcoming trainings.
