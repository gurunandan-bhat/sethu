Our Mental Health team supports children, adolescents up till the age of 19 years for a range of concerns around anxiety, self-esteem, bullying and other learning, emotional and behavioural difficulties in complete confidentiality. We counsel parents individually and through family intervention sessions on effective parenting through healthy communication, understanding and responding to emotions and promoting parental mental wellbeing. Our use of narrative therapy is respectful, non-blaming and a collaborative approach to support the young people we work with to understand their problems, and develop healthy perspectives, experiences and actions. Therapy sessions with children and/or parents may be short- or long-term depending on the support required.
