Our speech and language therapists support children with varied communication needs including autistic children, those with cerebral palsy, Down Syndrome and a range of other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Children with limited verbal communication or non-speaking children are supported through AAC (Alternative & Augmentative Communication), such as AVAZ or other low tech options where they can communicate using pictures and/or written words.
