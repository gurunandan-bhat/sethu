At AATISH, our autism intervention programme, we use a variety of play-based as well as structured approaches to understand the interests, strengths and needs of autistic children. We create customised intervention plans for each child and coach families to support their children at home. Sethu is the only non-profit in India to offer the Social ABCsâ„¢ (www.socialabcs.ca) intervention for autistic toddlers. We also conduct group programmes, such as on fine motor development, feeding and social inclusion.
