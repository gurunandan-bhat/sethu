Developmental and learning disabilities can overwhelm children and adolescents, leading them to react in ways that are labelled ‘bad’ or ‘naughty’, when these are often just signs of unfulfilled needs. Our support plans account for the environmental factors influencing a child's behaviour, as well the purpose which the behaviour serves. Behaviour support plans include modifying the child's environment, including parenting, and we coach families to encourage, motivate and spark joy in children.
