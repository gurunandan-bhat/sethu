Our special educators help children who need support with academic learning, such as with reading, writing, comprehension and numeracy to cope with their schoolwork. Online and in-person training for parents and teachers is conducted on a range of topics such as learning disabilities, building life skills (such as bathing, getting dressed, brushing hair and teeth), toilet training, introduction to disability and classroom management, and inclusive education.
