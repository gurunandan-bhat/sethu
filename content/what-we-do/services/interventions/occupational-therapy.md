Occupational therapy helps children with physical, sensory and cognitive problems become more independent at self-care, school and play. We’re the only nonprofit in Goa to offer aqua therapy, with its many physical, social and emotional benefits. Our occupational therapists conduct a detailed assessment of the child’s needs, provide a comprehensive written and verbal report, devise treatment plans and home plans, and conduct individual sessions as required.
