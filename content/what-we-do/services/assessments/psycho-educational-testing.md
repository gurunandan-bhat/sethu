+++

Children with academic difficulties, such as subject comprehension, learning retention and poor reading, spelling, written expression and math skills can benefit from psycho-educational testing. After establishing a rapport with the child to put them at ease, we test their abstract reasoning, problem solving skills, memory and attention span, critical thinking and other areas that influence academic achievement.
