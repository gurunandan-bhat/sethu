Children with academic difficulties in reading, spelling, writing and math can benefit from more detailed evaluations, such as psycho-educational testing, reviews of their schoolwork, reports from their teachers, and even school visits if necessary, so that we can ,observe the child at work and play. Our psycho-educational tests begin with establishing a rapport with the child so that they’re at their confident, comfortable best. We conduct standardised psychological tests of abstract reasoning, problem solving skills, memory and attention span, critical thinking and other functions for a complete picture of the child’s learning challenges to be able to arrive at the most suitable ways forward.
