Child development is a dynamic process. Our conversations with the child and family help us acquire important information about the child’s history, current concerns and what has been tried in the past. Developmental assessments address various areas of functioning such as communication, gross and fine motor development, cognition and learning, play, socio-emotional and self-help skills. We also conduct neurological and sensory assessments. We screen for reading, writing and numeracy skills in children with behaviour and academic concerns. We also talk to teachers and other significant caregivers, if necessary, for information that will help us get a thorough understanding of the child’s strengths and difficulties.
