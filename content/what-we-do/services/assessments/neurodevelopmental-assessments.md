We assess the childâ€™s development in the areas of communication, gross and fine motor function, cognition and learning, play, socio-emotional and self-help skills. We also assess the functioning of the brain, spinal cord, nerves and muscles, and review their hearing and vision reports. For school-going children with behaviour and learning concerns, we go over their schoolwork, a report from their teachers, and may visit the school to observe the child at work and play.
