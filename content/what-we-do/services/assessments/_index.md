Our assessment and testing services help identify developmental delays, understand a child’s areas of difficulty, and develop intervention plans to enhance their abilities and prevent future challenges. Our love for children – and toys! Lots of toys! – certainly contributes to creating a warm, welcoming, friendly environment by bringing out the best in children by celebrating neurodiversity, and focusing on their strengths and interests.
