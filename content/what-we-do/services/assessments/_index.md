Our assessment and testing services help identify developmental delays, understand a child’s areas of difficulty, and develop intervention plans to enhance their abilities and prevent future challenges.

Our love for children – and toys! Lots of toys! – create a warm, welcoming environment that celebrates neurodiversity, focuses on strengths and interests, and in doing so, brings out the best in every child.

Sethu is committed to family-centred care, in which children and families are experts of their lives and partners in our work. Our assessment and diagnostic services start with identifying the strengths and resources that every child and family bring with them. We use structured approaches and standardised testing to understand a child’s areas of difficulty, identify developmental delays, explore solutions and develop intervention plans in collaboration with the families. Our warm, welcoming, friendly environment celebrates neurodiversity by focusing on the strengths and interests of the children walking through our doors.
