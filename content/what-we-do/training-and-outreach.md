Inculcating a culture of learning and evidence-based action by proactively engaging, collaborating with and building capacities through webinars, collaborative workshops and other training programmes, is a very important aspect of our work.

### Webinars and Workshops

Our training for families, teachers, students and other professionals is delivered through webinars and in-person collaborative workshops on a range of subjects, such as sexuality education, ADHD, behaviour and inclusion in school. They’re particularly powerful in that they share the lived experiences of parents who’ve experienced success in these areas.

Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay notified about upcoming trainings.
