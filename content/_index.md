Sethu is an award-winning non-profit that caters to the developmental, behavioural, emotional and educational needs of children and young people aged 0—19 years through interdisciplinary services.

‘Sethu’ means ‘bridge’ because we build bridges between children and all those who care for them &mdash; their families, schools and communities &mdash; through collaboration and capacity building.

##### Our Vision

An inclusive world that nurtures and celebrates every child.

##### Our Mission

To be a centre of excellence in child development, family-centred care and inclusion through
interdisciplinary services, training, advocacy and research

##### A Culture of Trust

We’re committed to doing what is right, delivering what we promise and working with accountability, compassion, excellence and dedication to those we serve. Child protection, both internally and elsewhere is a non-negotiable aspect of our work.
