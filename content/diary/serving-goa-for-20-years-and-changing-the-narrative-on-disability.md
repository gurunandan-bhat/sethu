Twenty years ago, six women sat around a table in Goa with a dream that felt bigger than themselves — to create a safe, welcoming space where children with developmental and behavioural needs, and their families, could find understanding, support, and dignity.

That dream became the Sethu Centre for Child Development and Family Guidance.

We began in 2005 with just three trustees, three staff members, and countless questions — but one unwavering purpose: to stand beside every child and every family, not with judgment, but with care. There were no maps to follow, only a compass of hope. No promises, only the courage to take the first step.

Back then, the word _disability_ was still wrapped in silence. Many parents walked a lonely path — weighed down by shame, confusion, and fear. Support was scarce. Resources were rare. And spaces where families felt truly seen and understood were almost nonexistent.

But together, we began to rewrite that story.

_From silence to openness; We’ve created safe spaces in schools, communities, and homes — where conversations about neurodivergence are normal, compassionate, and informed._  
_From isolation to belonging; We’ve connected families not just to services, but to each other. We’ve helped them realise they’re not alone._  
_From temporary fixes to lasting change; We’ve worked across systems — disability rights in education, healthcare, access to services— to build a more inclusive Goa from the inside out._  
_From ‘what’s wrong?’ to ‘what’s strong?; that’s always been our focus— strengths, possibilities, and potential._

Today, in 2025, we are a team of 30 dedicated professionals guided by five trustees, who have served thousands of families across Goa. We have grown in size, in strength, and in spirit — but what anchors us still is that very same belief: every child deserves to be seen, to be supported, and to shine.

We continue to change the story of disability in Goa — one family at a time. This is what has always set Sethu apart — our deep commitment to family-centred care. We do not see children in isolation. We recognise that the well-being and progress of a child are deeply tied to the environment around them — particularly their caregivers. That’s why we walk alongside their families, listening to their concerns, building their capacity, and empowering them with the tools and knowledge they need. We make space for tears and fears. We help families understand their children — and discover their strengths. This approach has transformed the way families experience support — not as one-off interventions, but as relationships built on trust, respect, and collaboration.

No one else in Goa offers this kind of family-centred care; where families are not just included, but honoured. Where they are not just cared for, but empowered. This is our heartbeat. And it’s what transforms support into healing.

### Two decades of shifting mindsets and opening hearts

And now, as we celebrate 20 years, we step into a new chapter — **our dream centre built to last**, in Guirim, Goa. Purpose-built for inclusion, joy, and belonging, this space is not just a building. It is a promise: that Sethu is here to stay, and that our work has only just begun.

We remember where we started — a rented room, a few referrals, and a lot of heart. And we see where we are now — a cornerstone of support in Goa’s disability landscape. We see parents who once walked-in with worry now standing tall as advocates. We see children once unheard now finding their voice.

Most of all, we see the story changing. With deep gratitude, and a heart full of hope — To every child who taught us more than we ever imagined… To every parent who trusted us with their fears and dreams… To every colleague, donor, partner, and friend who walked this path with us…

Thank you. This anniversary is not just ours — it is yours too — because _‘Tumi sogllem, Sethuchem khambe ’_

And now as we look ahead — to new children, new challenges, and new beginnings — we know this for sure: The journey continues. The love deepens and the bridge we’re building grows stronger, every day. Here’s to the next 20 years. Here’s to changing the story, together.
