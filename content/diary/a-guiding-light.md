_This is the story of how a small centre in Goa became the guiding light our family needed. A story of hope, healing, and the quiet
miracles that helped our twin neurodivergent girls grow brave and strong._

A gift from God, two tender stars\
who shimmered a bit differently from afar.\
Their gentle hearts, their quiet fears,\
became my compass through the years.

I searched for answers, a hand to hold,\
a place to be understood, not to be told.

Through crowded halls and therapy doors,\
I wandered and reached the Goan shores.

Then, like a Christmas light in misty air,\
Sethu found us, soft and rare.\
They saw our strength behind our tears,\
held our hands, dissolved our fears.

In this calm, we built anew,\
left the known for what was true.\
A home in pieces, love intact,\
a leap of faith, no turning back.

At sixteen, my girls found space\
where gentle hearts could grow with grace.\
And Sethu stayed as our steadfast flame,\
a guiding light that knew our name.

And when that light led me to give\
the hope they gave, a way to live.\
I joined the hands that once held mine,\
to help more lives begin to shine.

For every child deserves a place\
that meets their dreams with soft embrace;\
a space where every ability grows brave and strong,\
where every voice feels safe to belong.

So this Christmas, I ask you to hear our call\
to ensure there is a chance for all.\
A place where every child is seen,\
their lives held gently, bright, and keen.

Walk with us…\
in love, in faith, in the magic we spread.\
Together, we’ll keep the promise of Christmas \- **a light for the road ahead.**
