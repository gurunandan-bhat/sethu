The theme for World Disability Day 2025 _‘Fostering disability-inclusive societies for advancing social progress’_ deeply resonates with me, both as a parent and as an advocate.

As a mother of twins with Williams Syndrome and on the autism spectrum, I’ve learned that parenting isn’t about fitting into a mould; it’s about understanding, adapting, and celebrating each child’s unique rhythm. For instance, one of my daughters likes doing things her own way and on her own terms, while her twin thrives on structure and routine, finding comfort in predictability. Their differences have taught me that there isn’t one “right” way to grow, learn, or express yourself. Every brain is different and those differences are not deficits but beautiful variations that make our world richer, more creative, and more compassionate. At first, I was overwhelmed with uncertainty about their future. But over time, I’ve realised my children didn’t need to be “fixed”; they needed to be _accepted._ And acceptance begins with _understanding._

That’s where Sethu Centre for Child Development and Family Guidance came into our lives and made a transformative difference. For years, my twins were deeply sensitive to loud sounds like firecrackers, thunder, etc. What began as discomfort grew into real fear. Well-meaning people would say, “They’ll get used to it,” but forcing them to face those fears only made things worse. At Sethu, for the first time, someone told my girls, _“It’s okay to be afraid”._ Instead of trying to erase their fear, the therapists helped them understand it, teaching them gentle coping strategies and ways to self-regulate. It was a shift from _what's wrong_ to _strong,_ that changed everything for them and for us as a family.

This is how Sethu bridges gaps between children, families, and communities; through an approach that empowers families to celebrate every child’s strengths and recognise that inclusion means more than integration, it means creating spaces that truly value each child’s way of being. One such moment came when my daughter, after years of struggling to understand and express emotions, told me, _“Mumma, I was very scared and upset because of the crackers, but I was brave”._ For a child who once couldn’t name her feelings, those words were a milestone, a reminder that growth looks different for every child, and every step forward is worth celebrating.

Another celebratory moment was when my twins were encouraged by their special educator and their therapists at Sethu and The Owl House*,* to perform together at a Christmas Mela (one singing carols and the other playing the ukulele). The cheers and applause made them feel like _true rockstars\!_ _Their joy and confidence soared so high that they surprised us all by performing three more songs spontaneously, carried by pure excitement and acceptance. That moment captured what true inclusion feels like when a community believes in every child’s ability to shine._ Because inclusion doesn’t happen in isolation, it takes all of us. It **takes a village**, and the community is that village that makes it possible. When we stand together as parents, teachers, friends, and neighbours, we create spaces where every child feels seen, valued, and supported.

This year’s theme reminds us that fostering inclusive societies is not just about policy, it’s about people, building a world that values compassion over comparison, and acceptance over exclusion. Because, inclusion is not just a word, but a mindset.

## Let’s build that village of empathy and inclusion in Goa

**\*Start with Kindness** – Include everyone in your neighbourhood, school, or workplace. Encourage your children to play and celebrate with peers of all abilities. Friendships teach acceptance better than words.\*

**\*Make Spaces Accessible** – Support ramps, quiet areas etc. in public spaces, churches, temples, and cafés. Inclusion grows when everyone can participate.\*

**\*Celebrate Mindfully** – Goa’s festivals are full of spirit, but some find loud sounds distressing. During Saibeen, Christmas, Ganesh Chaturthi, and other Goan festivals, either avoid or choose minimum low-noise fireworks and moderate sound levels. Let joy include everyone.\*

**\*Lead by Example** – Show others how empathy looks in action, in how you speak, celebrate, and include. Share positive stories of inclusion in your community. Small awareness sparks big change.\*

These small acts build the “village” where everyone belongs. When we celebrate differences, we let children be themselves and that’s when they truly shine.

As a mother, I know how powerful it can be when someone chooses to see my children’s light. This World Disability Day, let’s take a step towards seeing the light in every child. Because when we foster inclusion, we don’t just change individual lives but advance the progress of society.
