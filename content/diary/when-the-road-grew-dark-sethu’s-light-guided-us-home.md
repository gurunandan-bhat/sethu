As a mother to twin neurodivergent girls, my journey into the world of neurodiversity has been both deeply personal and, over time, profoundly professional. What began as a desperate search for answers turned into a life-altering mission—one driven not only by love for my daughters but by the growing awareness that so many families like ours are quietly fighting the same battles, often in isolation.

For the past seventeen years, my husband and I have been raising our girls with Williams Syndrome, both of whom are also on the autism spectrum. It has been a journey filled with uncertainty, exhaustion, resilience, and deep humility. Back in Mumbai, I balanced the dual roles of mother and advertising professional in a high-pressure, fast-paced world. But eventually, I faced a decision that would change everything: I left my career to care for my daughters full-time.

There were many nights when we felt like we were stumbling in the dark, unsure if we were moving forward or simply circling around the same pain. More than anything, I longed for someone—anyone—to see us. Truly see us. Not just as a clinical case. Not just as another family with “special needs.” But as parents and their children walking a difficult, beautiful, and very real path.

Then came the turning point. A discovery that changed everything: **Sethu – Centre for** **Child Development and Family Guidance,** nestled in the tiny, quaint and welcoming state of Goa.

Sethu didn’t just look at our daughters and see their challenges—they saw their strengths. They didn’t treat them in isolation but embraced our entire family in the process of healing and growth. For the first time, I heard someone ask me, “How are you? Are you taking care of yourself?” That simple, compassionate question shattered a dam inside me. I came home that day and cried—not out of sadness, but from the overwhelming relief of finally being seen, heard, and held.

From Dr. Nandita de Souza, the Centre’s Director, to the Head Psychologist, to every therapist and even the kind reception staff—everyone echoed the same message: “Don’t worry. We are here. You are not alone.” And they meant it. They have walked with us, step by step, day after day, with a gentle strength that has been life-changing for our family. That support gave us the courage to make one of the most difficult decisions of our lives. We left the stability of our Mumbai home so that I could relocate with our daughters to Goa. We moved into a rented space. We split our family across cities; my husband’s work still keeps him in Mumbai and he travels back and forth on weekends. But for our girls, it was all worth it. Because deep down, we knew—we were doing what was right.

At 16, our daughters reached a crucial juncture in their lives. Sethu guided us to a vocational training centre in Goa—a warm, inclusive community where they could begin to learn, grow, and eventually contribute. Throughout this major transition, Sethu remained our anchor. Their continued presence, unwavering support, and belief in our daughters carried us through a time of deep uncertainty.

And then, something beautiful happened. About a year and a half after our move, I found myself drawn back into the professional world. But this time, it wasn’t just a return to work—it was a return with purpose. I joined the very team that had carried us. Today, I have the immense privilege of serving not just as a Parent Advisor, but as someone helping to carry forward Sethu’s mission: to enable every child to develop to their full potential and to work toward an inclusive world that nurtures and celebrates every child.

These words aren’t just part of Sethu’s mission statement. They are lived realities at Sethu. Every therapy session, every family meeting, every breakthrough—it all reflects this deep commitment to children and their families. But what we’ve also come to understand is that the work doesn’t end with childhood. These children grow up. They become adults with dreams, with potential, and with the right to live with dignity and opportunity. And that is why sustainability is not just a goal for Sethu—it is a necessity. True care requires consistency. It means ensuring that the very team offering hope—the psychologists, pediatricians, occupational, speech and aqua therapists, as well as the operations, admin, accounts, and MarCom teams—can continue their work without fear of burnout or instability.

Yet, in the world of nonprofits, there is a persistent myth: that administrative and operational costs are “overheads.” But these aren’t luxuries—they’re the very scaffolding that allows us to do our work with care and accountability. Without these systems, the mission crumbles. Without our people, the vision fades.

I have lived through the heartbreak of seeing therapists leave midstream in the past. Of watching my child regress because of service disruption. I’ve felt the sting of broken trust when a supportive environment suddenly disappears. At Sethu, we are committed to being the opposite of that. We want to be a place where services are not only excellent but reliable. Where care doesn’t just begin—it continues, uninterrupted.

Sethu is more than an organisation—it’s a lifeline. A sanctuary where families like mine find not just therapy, but hope. Where children are seen, celebrated, and guided to become the best version of themselves.

The growing demand for professional services for the underserved families we support has led us to move four times over the past 20 years. Our current space—a generous legacy donation from a beloved supporter—has served us well, but it lacks disability access and dedicated therapeutic areas. Goa’s children and families deserve better. That’s why we’re building our new home in Guirim, North Goa, designed to universal accessibility standards, ensuring it welcomes everyone, regardless of ability, experience, or language. We look forward to moving in by the end of this year. We’re on the home stretch and with the continued support of our well-wishers, we’re confident we’ll cross the finish line together. If our story has touched something in you, or even if you’ve simply felt the stirrings of compassion, we invite you to walk with us. Not because we ask for help, but because it is a privilege to be part of ‘a movement’ that is changing lives, one family at a time in Goa.

Together, let’s build a Sethu that lasts and keep the light of hope burning
