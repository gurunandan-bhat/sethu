                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Founded in 2005 by Dr Nandita de Souza, a developmental paediatrician, and five other champions for inclusion, Sethu was born of the conviction that all children, particularly the most vulnerable, must receive a fair chance to realise their potential.</p>
<p>Our first professional team comprised Dr Nandita, Yogita Joshi, special educator, and Anjali Barretto, speech and language therapist. Our three founder trustees were Elvina Menezes, Ameeta Mascarenhas and Sneha Bhandare. The first time we opened doors, it was in a compact two-bedroom apartment generously offered by Eric Menezes.</p>
<p>The demand for our services escalated rapidly, with an ever-increasing number of referrals, community outreach programmes, group interventions, and requests for training and internships. By the age of 18, we’d expanded our team ten times over and moved four times. Our last move was into a lovely property bequeathed by our dear friend and supporter, Alessandro Bafico.</p>
<p>In 2022, we completed the ground-breaking of our new building designed with fit-for-purpose facilities for assessments, a variety of therapies, counselling, safe play, teaching, training and much more. It will enable us to reach countless more children and those who care for them. Our permanent centre in Guirim, will serve as an example of what a neurodiversity-affirming space has to offer.</p>
<p>The pride and joy we get from our work is its own reward!</p>

			<p>So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,
carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,
and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually
followed slowly in the direction of the head.</p>

			<p>But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll
definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody
will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as
they open up at work before seven o’clock.”</p>

			<p>Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids
went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with
wine and water.</p>

			<p>And Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about
it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I
have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign
tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a cargo of iron.</p>
