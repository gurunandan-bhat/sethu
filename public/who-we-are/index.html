                <p>One of Sethu&rsquo;s strengths is its strong administration which follows the principles of sound management. The trust is administered by 5 trustees who work on a voluntary basis. The administrative team monitors all systems of management to ensure that team members adhere to proper planning and work schedules, accounting protocols are followed and excellence in service provision is achieved.</p>
            
                <h2><a href="/who-we-are/our-story/">Our Story</a></h2>
                <p>Founded in 2005 by Dr Nandita de Souza, a developmental paediatrician, and five other champions for inclusion, Sethu was born of the conviction that all children, particularly the most vulnerable, must receive a fair chance to realise their potential.</p>
<p>Our first professional team comprised Dr Nandita, Yogita Joshi, special educator, and Anjali Barretto, speech and language therapist. Our three founder trustees were Elvina Menezes, Ameeta Mascarenhas and Sneha Bhandare. The first time we opened doors, it was in a compact two-bedroom apartment generously offered by Eric Menezes.</p>

carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,
and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually
followed slowly in the direction of the head.</p>

			<p>But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll
definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody
will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as
they open up at work before seven o’clock.”</p>

			<p>Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids
went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with
wine and water.</p>

			<p>And Minerva answered, “I will tell you truly and particularly all about
it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I
have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign
tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a cargo of iron.</p>
