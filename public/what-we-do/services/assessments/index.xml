      <description>&lt;p&gt;Children with academic difficulties, such as subject comprehension, learning retention and poor reading, spelling, written expression and math skills can benefit from psycho-educational testing. After establishing a rapport with the child to put them at ease, we test their abstract reasoning, problem solving skills, memory and attention span, critical thinking and other areas that influence academic achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We assess the childâ€™s development in the areas of communication, gross and fine motor function, cognition and learning, play, socio-emotional and self-help skills. We also assess the functioning of the brain, spinal cord, nerves and muscles, and review their hearing and vision reports. For school-going children with behaviour and learning concerns, we go over their schoolwork, a report from their teachers, and may visit the school to observe the child at work and play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
